#### This is [my website](https://www.leonardofilipe.com) related repo where I publish trading algorithms for S&P500 stocks and market indexes!

#### The main objective is to be educational and help with idea generation, they're not appropriate for consumption since they are ~~overfitted~~ optimized but I'm aiming to publish some content on validation soon

Dependencies: Numpy; Scipy; Pandas; Matplotlib and Requests (for fetching Yahoo Finance data)

#### Difficulty

Moderate:

[ML Based Pairs Trading](DecisionTreeRegression.ipynb) - Simple ML demonstration of a Decision Tree Regressor applied to the previous Pairs example

Basic:

[Long Only Pairs Trading](PairsTrading.ipynb) - A simple pairs trading strategy focused on buying the loser! Signal is given by rolling correlation

Introductory:

[Dynamic Asset Allocation](DynamicAssetAllocation.ipynb) - Encouraging dynamic capital allocation (not rebalacing)! [#Think Bayes](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2)
