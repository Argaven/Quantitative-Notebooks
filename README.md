#### This is [my website](https://leonardofilipe.com) related repo where I publish trading algorithms written in Python (on S&P500 stocks and market indexes) that used to be historically profitable, for educational purposes, using only Numpy, Scipy and Pandas (and Requests to obtain data from Yahoo Finance)
[Long Only Pairs Trading](PairsTrading.ipynb) - An illustrative example of a long only pairs trading strategy focused on minimizing weighted median drawdown with different holding periods between Coca Cola (KO) and Pepsico (PEP)

[Dynamic Asset Allocation](DynamicAssetAllocation.ipynb) - A demonstration on how to dynamically allocate capital between assets of a hypothetical portfolio conditionally in order to maximize historical return

[Geographical Diversification](GeographicDiversification.ipynb) - An illustrative example on the effects of international diversification, with a demonstration on how to optimize the weights of the various holdings in order to obtain an "optimally risk adjusted portfolio" (maximizing sharpe) between several market indexes

I'm Leonardo, a 22 year old that just graduated from a Corporate Finance BS, looking forward to share (some) of my insights on quantitative investment strategies
