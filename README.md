#### This is [my website](https://www.leonardofilipe.com) related repo where I publish some algorithms for S&P500 stocks and market indexes!

#### The main objective is helping with idea generation! Some of these 'strategies' might not be appropriate for consumption ~~due to overfitting~~ (it's meant to be educational)

Dependencies: Numpy; Pandas; Matplotlib and Requests (for fetching Yahoo Finance data)

#### Difficulty

Moderate:

[ML Based Pairs Trading](DecisionTreeRegressors.ipynb) - A simple Machine Learning example, Decision Tree Regressors applied to the previous pair (also requires Scikit-Learn)

Basic:

[Long Only Pairs Trading](PairsTrading.ipynb) - A simple pairs trading strategy focused on buying the loser! Signal is given by rolling correlation

Introductory:

[Dynamic Asset Allocation & Diversification](AssetAllocation.ipynb) - Exploring geographical diversification and optimizing capital allocation (also requires Scipy)

Market data last updated at 3 May 2019
